# Survey 3D - data collection from a browser

This application allows to:

- display your 3D assets and navigate between sites;
- install and persist data for offline usage;
- authenticate win an SSO, retrieve a list of POIs and position them in 3D;
- fill-in a customly created form for each POI;
- update and synchronize POIs with your own backend when back online.

The application is customizable: it works with any backend and any structure of the form.
