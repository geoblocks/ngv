# Digital twins: building permits

Municipalities: a common use-case for digital twins is to handle old/new building integration:

- Display a base 3D tileset with current buildings
- Load a 3D model from oneâ€™s computer / from a predefined URL
- Hide buildings overlapping the model and integrate it seamlessly
- Query a building on click or hover and show metadata
